## Proof of concept:

With the authentication manager for AbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter being of type AbstractPreAuthenticatedProcessingFilter and overriden methods:

```
@Override
protected Object getPreAuthenticatedPrincipal(HttpServletRequest request) {
    return request.getHeader("prince");
}

@Override
protected Object getPreAuthenticatedCredentials(HttpServletRequest request) {
    return request.getHeader("cred");
}
```

I have to actually include these headers or it won't play ball:

```
curl -H 'prince: jack' -H 'cred: ROLE_SOMETHING' localhost:8080/example
```
